When you donate a computer to Computers 4 People, one of the most common questions we hear is: "How do I know my personal data is really gone?" It's a valid concern. Your old devices contain years of personal information—documents, photos, passwords, browsing history, and more.

We take data security seriously. Every device that comes through our doors undergoes a rigorous, professional data erasure process that meets or exceeds industry standards. Here's exactly how we protect your privacy.

## Why Simply Deleting Files Isn't Enough

Many people think emptying the recycle bin or formatting a hard drive is enough to erase their data. Unfortunately, that's not true. When you delete a file, your computer only removes the reference to that file—the actual data remains on the drive until it's overwritten. With readily available recovery software, someone could easily retrieve your "deleted" files.

Even formatting a drive doesn't guarantee complete data removal. Professional data recovery tools can often restore formatted drives.

## Our Professional Data Erasure Process

At Computers 4 People, we use **Blancco Drive Eraser**, an industry-leading data sanitization solution trusted by government agencies, military organizations, and Fortune 500 companies worldwide.

### What Makes Blancco Different?

**NIST-Compliant Overwriting**: Blancco follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-88 guidelines for media sanitization. The software overwrites your entire drive multiple times with random patterns of data, making recovery impossible.

**Verification & Certification**: After erasure, Blancco generates a tamper-proof certificate of data destruction. This certificate proves that data was completely removed and provides an audit trail for compliance purposes.

**Works on All Drive Types**: Whether you're donating a traditional hard drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD), Blancco can securely erase it. SSDs require special handling due to their technology, and Blancco handles this automatically.

**Bootable Solution**: Blancco runs independently of your operating system, meaning it can erase drives even if the computer won't boot normally.

## Our Step-by-Step Process

Here's what happens when you donate a device to us:

1. **Intake & Inspection**: We receive your donated device and perform an initial assessment to determine if it's suitable for refurbishment.

2. **Data Erasure**: We boot the device using Blancco Drive Eraser and run a complete wipe of all storage drives. This process can take several hours depending on the drive size.

3. **Verification**: Blancco automatically verifies the erasure was successful and generates a certificate of data destruction.

4. **Documentation**: We maintain detailed records of every device erased, including serial numbers and erasure certificates.

5. **Refurbishment**: Only after data is completely erased do we proceed with testing, repairs, and operating system installation.

6. **Distribution**: The refurbished device is provided to someone in need, with a fresh, clean installation and zero traces of previous data.

## What Standards Do We Meet?

Our data erasure process meets or exceeds these recognized standards:

- **NIST SP 800-88**: U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines
- **DoD 5220.22-M**: U.S. Department of Defense standard (legacy)
- **GDPR Requirements**: European data protection regulations
- **ADISA Certification**: Asset Disposal and Information Security Alliance standards

## Can You Request Your Erasure Certificate?

Yes! If you're donating a device and want proof that your data was securely erased, we can provide you with the Blancco certificate of destruction upon request. This certificate includes:

- Date and time of erasure
- Device serial number and model
- Software version used
- Verification status
- Tamper-proof digital signature

## What About Phones and Tablets?

For mobile devices, we follow manufacturer guidelines for factory resets, which are designed to be secure on modern devices with encryption. However, we primarily focus on laptop and desktop computer donations, as these present more complex data security challenges.

## Still Have Concerns?

We understand that data privacy is personal. If you have specific concerns about your device, here are some additional steps you can take before donating:

**Remove Physical Storage**: If you want absolute certainty, you can remove the hard drive from your device before donating. We can still refurbish the computer by installing a donated or purchased drive.

**Encrypt Before Donation**: Modern operating systems like Windows 10/11 offer built-in encryption (BitLocker). Enabling encryption before wiping makes data recovery even more impossible.

**Ask Questions**: Contact us at info@computers4people.org if you have specific data security questions. We're happy to discuss our process in detail.

## The Bottom Line

When you donate to Computers 4 People, you can rest assured that your data is gone—completely and permanently. We use professional-grade tools, follow industry standards, and maintain detailed documentation of every erasure.

Your donated device will get a second life helping someone in need, and your personal information will never be at risk.
