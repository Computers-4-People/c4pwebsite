When you donate a computer to Computers 4 People, one of the most common questions we hear is: "How do I know my personal data is really gone?" It's a valid concern. Your old devices contain years of personal information, documents, photos, passwords, browsing history, and more.

We take data security seriously. Every device that comes through our doors undergoes a rigorous, professional data erasure process that meets or exceeds industry standards. Every device is serialized and tracked throughout the entire process. Here's exactly how we protect your privacy.

## Why Simply Deleting Files Isn't Enough

Many people think emptying the recycle bin or formatting a hard drive is enough to erase their data. Unfortunately, that's not true. When you delete a file, your computer only removes the reference to that file, the actual data remains on the drive until it's overwritten. With readily available recovery software, someone could easily retrieve your "deleted" files.

Even formatting a drive doesn't guarantee complete data removal. Professional data recovery tools can often restore formatted drives.

## Our Professional Data Erasure Process

At Computers 4 People, we use **BitRaser Drive Eraser**, an industry-leading data sanitization solution trusted by government agencies, military organizations, and Fortune 500 companies worldwide. Every device is assigned a unique serial number and tracked throughout the entire erasure and refurbishment process.

### What Makes BitRaser Different?

**NIST-Compliant Overwriting**: BitRaser follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-88 guidelines for media sanitization. The software overwrites your entire drive multiple times with random patterns of data, making recovery impossible.

**Verification & Certification**: After erasure, BitRaser generates a tamper-proof certificate of data destruction. This certificate proves that data was completely removed and provides an audit trail for compliance purposes. You can view your certificate anytime in our **Donor Portal**: [computers4people.org/auth](https://computers4people.org/auth).

**Works on All Drive Types**: Whether you're donating a traditional hard drive (HDD) or a solid-state drive (SSD), BitRaser can securely erase it. SSDs require special handling due to their technology, and BitRaser handles this automatically.

**Bootable Solution**: BitRaser runs independently of your operating system, meaning it can erase drives even if the computer won't boot normally.

**What About Unusable Drives?**: For drives that cannot be erased or refurbished, we partner with **R2 certified recyclers** who physically shred the drives to ensure complete data destruction. Everything is tracked by serial number.

## Our Step-by-Step Process

Here's what happens when you donate a device to us:

1. **Intake & Inspection**: We receive your donated device, assign it a unique serial number, and perform an initial assessment to determine if it's suitable for refurbishment.

2. **Data Erasure**: We boot the device using BitRaser Drive Eraser and run a complete wipe of all storage drives. This process can take several hours depending on the drive size. The serial number is recorded with the erasure certificate.

3. **Verification**: BitRaser automatically verifies the erasure was successful and generates a certificate of data destruction linked to the device serial number.

4. **Documentation**: We maintain detailed records of every device erased, including serial numbers and erasure certificates. You can access your donation history and certificates in the **Donor Portal**: [computers4people.org/auth](https://computers4people.org/auth).

5. **Drive Disposal (if needed)**: If a drive cannot be erased or is not suitable for reuse, we send it to our R2 certified recycling partners who physically shred it. All disposal is tracked by serial number.

6. **Refurbishment**: Only after data is completely erased do we proceed with testing, repairs, and operating system installation.

7. **Distribution**: The refurbished device is provided to someone in need, with a fresh, clean installation and zero traces of previous data.

## What Standards Do We Meet?

Our data erasure process meets or exceeds these recognized standards:

- **NIST SP 800-88**: U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines
- **DoD 5220.22-M**: U.S. Department of Defense standard (legacy)
- **GDPR Requirements**: European data protection regulations
- **ADISA Certification**: Asset Disposal and Information Security Alliance standards

## Can You View Your Erasure Certificate?

Yes! Every device receives a BitRaser certificate of destruction that you can access online in our **Donor Portal**. Simply log in at **[computers4people.org/auth](https://computers4people.org/auth)** to view your complete donation history and all data destruction certificates. Each certificate includes:

- Date and time of erasure
- Device serial number and model
- Software version used
- Verification status
- Tamper-proof digital signature
- Complete audit trail

## What About Phones and Tablets?

For mobile devices, we follow manufacturer guidelines for factory resets, which are designed to be secure on modern devices with encryption. However, we primarily focus on laptop and desktop computer donations, as these present more complex data security challenges.

## Still Have Concerns?

We understand that data privacy is personal. If you have specific concerns about your device, here are some additional steps you can take before donating:

**Remove Physical Storage**: If you want absolute certainty, you can remove the hard drive from your device before donating. We can still refurbish the computer by installing a donated or purchased drive.

**Encrypt Before Donation**: Modern operating systems like Windows 10/11 offer built-in encryption (BitLocker). Enabling encryption before wiping makes data recovery even more impossible.

**Ask Questions**: Contact us at info@computers4people.org if you have specific data security questions. We're happy to discuss our process in detail.

## The Bottom Line

When you donate to Computers 4 People, you can rest assured that your data is gone, completely and permanently. We use professional-grade tools, follow industry standards, and maintain detailed documentation of every erasure. Every device is tracked by serial number from intake through distribution or recycling.

Your donated device will get a second life helping someone in need, and your personal information will never be at risk.

## Ready to Donate?

If you have computers, laptops, or tablets to donate, we make it easy. We offer free pickup for bulk donations (50+ devices) and convenient drop-off locations throughout New Jersey, New York City, and Massachusetts.

Windows 11 brought a fresh design and new features, but it also introduced stricter hardware requirements than any previous Windows version. Many people with perfectly functional computers discovered their devices could not upgrade. Here's everything you need to know about Windows 11 compatibility.

## What Are the Basic Requirements?

Microsoft requires the following minimum specifications for Windows 11:

**Processor**: 1 GHz or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC)

**RAM**: 4 GB minimum

**Storage**: 64 GB or larger storage device

**System Firmware**: UEFI, Secure Boot capable

**TPM**: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0

**Graphics Card**: Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver

**Display**: High definition (720p) display, 9 inches or greater diagonal, 8 bits per color channel

## The TPM 2.0 Requirement: The Big Barrier

The most controversial requirement is TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module). This is a security chip that encrypts data and verifies system integrity. Many computers from before 2016 do not have TPM 2.0, and some have it disabled in the BIOS.

### How to Check If You Have TPM 2.0

**Windows Search Method**: Press Windows key and type "tpm.msc" then press Enter. If you see "Compatible TPM cannot be found," your computer does not have TPM 2.0 enabled.

**PC Health Check**: Download Microsoft's PC Health Check tool from their website. It will tell you if your computer meets all Windows 11 requirements.

### Can You Enable TPM?

Some computers have TPM 2.0 hardware but it's disabled. You can enable it in your BIOS/UEFI settings:

1. Restart your computer and enter BIOS (usually by pressing F2, F10, Del, or Esc during boot)
2. Look for Security or Advanced settings
3. Find TPM, PTT (Intel), or fTPM (AMD)
4. Enable it and save changes

## CPU Compatibility: The 8th Generation Cutoff

Microsoft officially supports Intel 8th generation processors and newer, or AMD Ryzen 2000 series and newer. This means many computers from 2017 and earlier are not officially supported.

**Intel**: 8th Gen (Coffee Lake) and newer
**AMD**: Ryzen 2000 series and newer

If you have a 7th generation Intel processor or 1st generation Ryzen, Microsoft considers your computer too old, even if it runs perfectly fine.

## What If Your Computer Is Not Compatible?

You have several options if your computer cannot upgrade to Windows 11:

### Option 1: Stay on Windows 10

Windows 10 will receive security updates until **October 14, 2025**. That's plenty of time to plan your next move. Windows 10 remains stable, secure, and fully functional.

### Option 2: Workarounds (Not Recommended)

Some people bypass Windows 11 requirements using registry edits or modified installers. **We do not recommend this** because:

- You won't receive important security updates
- Your computer may have stability issues
- Some features may not work properly
- Microsoft could block these methods in the future

### Option 3: Donate and Upgrade

If your computer is incompatible with Windows 11 and you need newer hardware, consider donating your old device to Computers 4 People. We can:

- Securely wipe your data using BitRaser (view certificates at [computers4people.org/auth](https://computers4people.org/auth))
- Refurbish it with Windows 10 or Linux
- Provide it to someone in need who can still use it productively

Your "outdated" computer can still change someone's life. Many people only need basic computing for email, web browsing, document editing, and video calls. Windows 10 handles these tasks perfectly.

[**Donate your computer here**](/donate)

### Option 4: Try Linux

Linux is a free, open-source operating system that runs great on older hardware. Popular beginner-friendly versions include:

**Ubuntu**: User-friendly, similar to Windows
**Linux Mint**: Very familiar for Windows users
**Pop!_OS**: Great for former Windows users

Linux receives regular updates and security patches regardless of your hardware age. It's perfect for web browsing, office work, and media consumption.

## Should You Buy a New Computer?

Before spending money, ask yourself:

**What do you actually use your computer for?** If it's mainly web browsing, email, and documents, Windows 10 will work fine until 2025.

**Is your computer running well?** If it's slow, often a simple RAM upgrade or switching to an SSD can make a huge difference, much cheaper than a new computer.

**Do you need Windows specifically?** Many people can switch to a Chromebook or try Linux and save money.

## The Environmental Impact

Microsoft's strict requirements mean millions of perfectly functional computers become "obsolete" overnight. This creates massive electronic waste. A 2021 study estimated that **240 million devices** would become e-waste due to Windows 11 requirements.

At Computers 4 People, we believe working computers should not go to waste. These devices can:

- Be donated to people who need them
- Run Windows 10 until 2025 (and beyond with extended support)
- Run Linux indefinitely
- Be refurbished and reused

## What Happens After October 2025?

When Windows 10 support ends in October 2025:

**Your computer will still work**: Windows 10 does not stop functioning. You just won't get new security updates.

**You can pay for extended support**: Microsoft will offer Extended Security Updates (ESU) for businesses, similar to what they did with Windows 7.

**You can switch to Linux**: A free, secure alternative that works great on older hardware.

**You can donate it**: Let someone else benefit from your working computer.

## The Bottom Line

Windows 11's strict requirements mean many great computers are "incompatible" even though they work perfectly. You have until October 2025 before Windows 10 support ends. That's time to:

- Continue using your computer as-is
- Plan a donation and upgrade path
- Explore Linux as an alternative
- Make an informed decision without rushing

If you decide to upgrade and want to donate your old computer, we make it easy. We'll securely erase your data, refurbish the device, and give it to someone who needs it.

Choosing between a mobile hotspot and traditional home internet can be confusing. Both connect you to the internet, but they work very differently and serve different needs. Here's everything you need to know to make the right choice.

## What Is a Mobile Hotspot?

A mobile hotspot is a portable device that connects to cellular networks (4G LTE or 5G) and creates a Wi-Fi network you can use with your devices. Think of it as a pocket-sized router that works anywhere there's cell service.

**How it works**: The hotspot uses a SIM card to connect to cellular towers, just like your phone. It then broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal that your laptop, tablet, or other devices can connect to.

## What Is Home Internet?

Home internet typically means a fixed connection installed at your address. This includes cable, fiber, DSL, or fixed wireless internet. It requires professional installation and only works at your home.

**How it works**: A physical line (cable or fiber) or fixed wireless antenna connects your home to the internet provider's network. A router distributes the connection throughout your home via Wi-Fi or ethernet cables.

## Speed Comparison

**Mobile Hotspots (4G/5G)**:
- 4G LTE: 10-50 Mbps download typically
- 5G: 50-300+ Mbps download in good coverage areas
- Speed varies based on location, network congestion, and signal strength

**Home Internet**:
- Cable: 100-1000 Mbps typically
- Fiber: 300-2000 Mbps typically
- DSL: 10-100 Mbps typically
- Fixed Wireless: 25-100 Mbps typically

**Winner**: Home internet generally offers faster and more consistent speeds, especially fiber. However, 5G hotspots in good coverage areas can match or exceed cable speeds.

## Portability: The Game Changer

**Mobile Hotspot**: Take it anywhere. Use it at home, at the park, in your car, at a coffee shop, anywhere with cell coverage. Perfect for people who move frequently or need internet on the go.

**Home Internet**: Fixed to one address. You cannot take it with you when you travel or move between locations.

**Winner**: Mobile hotspot wins hands down for portability.

## Data Limits and Throttling

**Mobile Hotspots**: Most plans have data limits or throttling after certain usage levels. Shield Internet offers **unlimited data** with potential speed reductions during network congestion after 100GB per month.

**Home Internet**: Most cable and fiber plans offer truly unlimited data with no throttling. Some rural or satellite providers have data caps.

**Winner**: Home internet typically has fewer restrictions, but unlimited mobile plans like Shield Internet bridge this gap.

## Cost Comparison

**Mobile Hotspot Plans**:
- Shield Internet: **$14.89/month** (unlimited data)
- Major carriers: $30-80/month typically
- Hotspot device: $0-300 one-time cost

**Home Internet**:
- Cable: $50-120/month typically
- Fiber: $50-100/month typically
- DSL: $40-70/month typically
- Installation fees: $0-100 one-time
- Equipment rental: $10-15/month often

**Winner**: Mobile hotspots like Shield Internet are significantly more affordable, especially with no installation fees or contracts.

## Setup and Installation

**Mobile Hotspot**: Insert SIM card, power on, connect devices. Takes 5 minutes. No technician needed.

**Home Internet**: Professional installation often required, takes hours or days to schedule. May require drilling holes, running cables, and installing equipment.

**Winner**: Mobile hotspot for speed and simplicity.

## Reliability and Consistency

**Mobile Hotspot**: Depends on cellular coverage. Can be affected by weather, building materials, network congestion, and distance from towers. More variable than home internet.

**Home Internet**: Generally more stable and consistent, especially wired connections like cable or fiber. Weather and other factors have less impact.

**Winner**: Home internet is typically more reliable, though 5G coverage is improving rapidly.

## Number of Devices

**Mobile Hotspot**: Most support 5-15 connected devices. Performance decreases as more devices connect.

**Home Internet**: Can handle 20-50+ devices depending on router quality and connection speed.

**Winner**: Home internet handles more simultaneous devices better.

## Best Use Cases for Mobile Hotspots

**Budget-Conscious**: Shield Internet mobile plan at $14.89/month is the most affordable reliable option.

## Making Your Decision

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **How many people will use it simultaneously?** More people = home internet advantage
2. **What is my budget?** Under $20/month = mobile hotspot
3. **Do I move frequently?** Yes = mobile hotspot
4. **What speeds are available at my address?** If fiber is available and affordable, consider it
5. **What is my primary use?** Streaming/gaming = home internet, general use = mobile works great
6. **Is reliability critical?** Mission-critical work = home internet backup

## The Bottom Line

Neither option is universally better. Mobile hotspots excel at affordability, portability, and quick setup. Home internet excels at speed, capacity, and reliability for stationary use.

For most budget-conscious people, families needing flexible internet, or anyone who values portability, Shield Internet's mobile hotspot and 5G home router options provide excellent value at **$14.89/month**.

Slow hotspot speeds can be frustrating when you are trying to work, stream, or browse. The good news is that most speed issues have simple solutions. Here are 10 proven ways to improve your mobile hotspot speed.

## 1. Position Your Hotspot Near a Window

Cell signals have difficulty penetrating buildings, especially those with brick, concrete, or metal construction. Your hotspot connects to cellular towers, so signal strength is everything.

**What to do**:
- Place your hotspot near a window, ideally on a windowsill
- Choose windows facing the direction of nearby cell towers
- Avoid basements and interior rooms
- Higher floors generally get better signal than lower floors

**Why it works**: Windows provide the least obstruction for cell signals. Even a few feet can make a significant difference in signal strength and speed.

## 2. Elevate Your Hotspot

Radio signals travel better through air than through obstacles. Placing your hotspot higher reduces interference from furniture, appliances, and building materials.

**What to do**:
- Place your hotspot on a shelf, desk, or cabinet, not on the floor
- Avoid putting it behind computers or inside drawers
- Keep it in the open, not enclosed in furniture
- The higher the better, within reason (a bookshelf works great)

**Why it works**: Elevation reduces ground-level interference and improves the line of sight to cell towers.

## 3. Check Your Signal Strength

You cannot fix what you cannot measure. Most hotspots have signal strength indicators (usually bars or lights).

**What to do**:
- Check your hotspot's signal indicator
- Move around your space while watching the signal
- Find the "sweet spot" with the strongest signal
- Use your phone's field test mode for precise signal measurements

**Signal strength guide**:
- 5 bars = Excellent (fast speeds)
- 4 bars = Good (reliable speeds)
- 3 bars = Fair (usable but slower)
- 1-2 bars = Poor (slow, unreliable)

**If you have weak signal**: Try tips 1, 2, and 4. Consider an external antenna if available for your device.

## 4. Reduce Connected Devices

Every device connected to your hotspot shares the available bandwidth. More devices = slower speeds for everyone.

**What to do**:
- Disconnect devices you are not actively using
- Check what is connected (usually in your hotspot's settings or app)
- Remove unknown devices (change your password if you see unfamiliar connections)
- Prioritize devices that need speed most

**Why it works**: A mobile hotspot has limited bandwidth. One device gets 100% of available speed. Ten devices each get about 10%.

## 5. Change Your Wi-Fi Band

Modern hotspots often support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands. Each has different characteristics.

**2.4 GHz**:
- Better range, penetrates walls better
- More congested, slower speeds
- Better for large homes or many walls

**5 GHz**:
- Faster speeds, less interference
- Shorter range, blocked more by walls
- Better for close devices and speed-critical tasks

**What to do**:
- Try switching bands in your hotspot settings
- Use 5 GHz when close to your hotspot for maximum speed
- Use 2.4 GHz if you need better range

**Why it works**: Different bands perform better in different environments. Experiment to find what works best for your situation.

## 6. Restart Your Hotspot Regularly

Like all technology, hotspots benefit from occasional restarts. This clears memory, refreshes network connections, and can resolve many issues.

**What to do**:
- Power off your hotspot completely
- Wait 30 seconds
- Power it back on
- Wait for it to reconnect before using

**When to restart**:
- Once a week for routine maintenance
- When speeds seem slower than usual
- After firmware updates
- When you move to a new location

**Why it works**: Restarting clears temporary glitches, drops old connections, and forces a fresh network registration.

## 7. Avoid Peak Usage Hours

Cell networks get congested during peak hours, just like highways during rush hour. More users on the tower = slower speeds for everyone.

**Peak hours typically**:
- 6-10 PM weeknights (after work/school)
- Weekends during daytime
- Lunch hours (12-1 PM)
- Major events in your area

**What to do**:
- Schedule large downloads for off-peak hours (late night/early morning)
- Use off-peak times for video calls and streaming when possible
- Be patient during peak hours, speeds will improve later

**Why it works**: Network congestion is temporary. Your connection will be faster when fewer people are online.

## 8. Keep Your Hotspot Cool

Electronics generate heat, and excessive heat can cause devices to throttle performance to protect themselves.

**What to do**:
- Keep your hotspot in a well-ventilated area
- Do not cover it with papers, fabric, or other items
- Avoid direct sunlight
- Do not leave it in a hot car
- If it feels hot, turn it off briefly to cool down

**Why it works**: Overheating triggers thermal throttling, which intentionally slows down the device to reduce heat generation.

## 9. Update Your Hotspot's Firmware

Manufacturers release firmware updates to fix bugs, improve performance, and add features. Running old firmware can hurt your speeds.

**What to do**:
- Check your hotspot manufacturer's website or app for updates
- Follow their instructions to update firmware
- Enable automatic updates if available
- Check for updates monthly

**Why it works**: Firmware updates often include network optimizations, bug fixes, and improvements to how your device connects to cell towers.

## 10. Close Background Apps and Downloads

The devices connected to your hotspot might be using bandwidth in the background without you knowing.

**What to do**:
- Close apps you are not using
- Pause cloud backups (iCloud, Google Photos, etc.)
- Disable automatic updates on your devices
- Check for background downloads (Windows updates, app updates)
- Turn off auto-play on streaming apps

**Hidden bandwidth users**:
- Cloud photo/file syncing
- Operating system updates
- App store auto-updates
- Smart home devices checking for updates
- Game consoles downloading patches

**Why it works**: Background processes can consume significant bandwidth. Stopping them frees up speed for what you are actively using.

## Bonus Tips for Shield Internet Users

If you are using Shield Internet, here are specific tips:

**Use the 5G Home Router for home use**: It is designed for better range and can handle more devices than portable hotspots.

**Check coverage maps**: Shield Internet uses the largest 5G network. [Check coverage in your area](https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map?icid=MGPO_TMO_P_TMOSWAPPNP_0BLNXB4P50PQBSLHM30956).

**Contact support if speeds are consistently slow**: Email info@computers4people.org. Sometimes issues require network-side fixes.

**Try different locations in your home**: Sometimes moving just 10 feet makes a huge difference.

## When to Expect Slower Speeds

Shield Internet and most mobile internet services may experience reduced speeds:

**During network congestion**: When many people in your area are online
**After 100GB usage in a month**: Data deprioritization may occur during congestion
**In rural or remote areas**: Farther from towers = potentially slower speeds
**Inside certain buildings**: Thick walls, metal structures, and underground locations

## Speed Test Reality Check

When running speed tests, remember:

**4G LTE**: 10-50 Mbps is normal
**5G**: 50-300+ Mbps depending on coverage
**Location matters**: Speed varies dramatically by location

**What speeds do you need?**
- Web browsing: 5 Mbps
- Video calls: 5-10 Mbps
- HD streaming: 5-8 Mbps
- 4K streaming: 25 Mbps
- Large downloads: More is better, but not required for basic use

If you are getting these speeds, your internet is working well for most tasks, even if speed tests show "only" 20-30 Mbps.

## The Bottom Line

Improving mobile hotspot speed usually comes down to three things:

1. **Better signal**: Position, elevation, and location matter
2. **Less interference**: Fewer devices, better bands, avoiding congestion
3. **Device optimization**: Restarts, updates, and managing connected devices

Try these tips one by one. Most people see significant improvements by combining just 2-3 of these strategies.
