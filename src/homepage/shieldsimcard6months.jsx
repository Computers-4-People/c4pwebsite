    question: "When will my order arrive?",
    answer:
      "Most orders arrive in about 10 business days. If you order just the SIM card, it will ship on its own. If you order the hotspot, your SIM card will already be inside the device when it arrives. For the Shield 5G Home Router (pre-order), the shipping timeline is currently unknown - we’ll send you updates as soon as it’s on the way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the internet plan include?",
    answer:
      "You get unlimited internet on one of the biggest 5G networks in the country. No data overages. No annual service contract. On network coverage only, no domestic roaming. During congestion, customers on this plan may notice speeds lower than other customers and further reduction if using >100GB/mo., due to data prioritization.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the router locked or restricted?",
    answer:
      "The Shield 5G Home Router is fully unlocked and portable. It works with most SIM cards and supports 5G, 4G, and 3G networks. The Shield 5G Hotspot, however, is locked to work only with our Shield Internet plan.",
